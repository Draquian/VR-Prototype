# VR-Prototype

This is a VR game where you represent a great magician who dominates many magic, to defend your people from evil you will have to use your grimoire and your wand to channel magic and kill all the hordes of enemies.

Use your wand to select the spell you want to channel and throw it with all your might against your enemies, keep an eye on all sides so they don't get too close to you and finally, make sure the light doesn't go out or your life will end.

You can move your head to survey your entire area and press the B button to cast the spells, if you feel overwhelmed, grab the chickens and throw them.
